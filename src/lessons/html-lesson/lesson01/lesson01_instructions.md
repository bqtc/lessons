# HTML Lesson 01

## HTML Basic Structure
All of yoru webpages will start with the following structure:
`<html>
	<head>
	</head>
	<body>
	</body>
</html>`
Let's go through what everything means:
- `<html>` is the tag to tell the computer that you are writing HTML
- `<head>` think of this tag as the configuration tag. It tells the computer how you want to setup your webpage, and as we get more advanced might include some information about the looks and function of the page. But, for right now you can mostly ignore the `<head>` tag. Just remember that you should usually include it when you start writing a HTML document
- `<body>` is the most important tag here because we put all of our *content* in the body. This means that any text you want to show up on your webpage *must* go here.
- Note: notice the indentation of the HTML above. `<html>` isn't indentended, but `<head>` and `<body>` are. This is to help you keep track of where things are. HTML does not have to be indentended, but we recommend you do take a little extra time and ensure you properly indent your HTML.

## Lesson
1. Learn about the `<h1>` tag and put it in your body
2. Learn about the `<p>` tag and put one in your body
3. Learn about the `<title>` tag and put a title in your head (note: title is considered a configuration, so it goes in head and not body)
