# Introduction to HTML!

## HTML History

Sir Tim Berners-Lee, working at CERN, started thinking about how to share research documents with co-workers in the early 1980s. In 1990 he wrote a memo describing a simple system for sharing documents. This would become HTML.

## HTML Underlying Ideas

- HTML is a *markup language* at allows us to identify the types of elements in a document. For example, in a book an author might identify a chapter title and then a paragraph. Once elements are identified, we can control how they look. Following the previous example, a book author might want the chapter titles to be large and bold.
- HTML is *display independent* which means that a plain HTML file looks very messy because the author has to identify all the elements and the styles associated with each element. HTML only looks “pretty” when it is viewed in a web browser like Google Chrome.

## HTML Tags
So how does an author of an HTML document indicate where certain elements exist? TAGS! HTML tags wrap around text to declare the element type. They look like this: `<tag>some text here</tag>` and they always have a beginning: `<tag>` and an end: `<\tag>`

Here’s a real example:
The title tag is: `<h1>`, so a newspaper editor might write a title of an article like this: `<h1>Article Title Here</h1>`
