# Existing Sites
## Open twitter.com (or facebook.com for better mobile representation)
### Discuss browser location / URL
* General structure: scheme, hostname, path, fragment/query
### Discuss visual elements
* General layout, boxes, and columns
* Some elements are (selectable) text, others are images, still others are "controls"
* Try selecting text on the page, note how the selection highlight flows across the page
* Note some control interactions (like form validation) occur on "events" (user input)
### Open the web inspector
* Note that webpages have three major components: structure (HTML), style (CSS), and behavior (Javascript)
* All three are described textually
* Handle assets/resources (like images) later
### Switch to elements inspector
* Note that HTML is described with "tags" using angle brackets (&lt;&gt;), and have "open" and "close" types
* Note the general code coloring, and start selecting elements to indicate their position on the page (side-by-side)
* This demonstrates the relationship between the (still) incomprehensible text and its visual representation
### Pick a simple tag (H2 or P)
* Explain how structure/content is contained between the tags, and attributes are provided in the open tag
* Examine some of the tag's characteristics: tag style, classes, inline style, and contents
* Briefly discuss style, and its difference between structure/content
### Select other tags
* Note how sibling elements may be laid out nonlinearly
* Brief discussion of the semantic web? Different tags have different meanings/uses/purposes, more like a report written in Microsoft Word
### Switch to [Re]sources Inspector
* Discuss other assets used by the page, like images and javascript
* All are referenced (at root) by the HTML file which is the page
### Try submitting a form
* Even empty, the URL may change, and content returned will be based on form contents
