# Lessons

A place to compile our thoughts/code.

## Directory Structure

`src/prototypes` contains source code of fully-built projects, not necessarily
divided into coherent steps. These are finished products that we can use to
derive lessons.

`src/lessons/<name>` contain the individual lessons. I propose that these
folders should be named, and not numbered, with the README responsible for
linking to them in a sensible orderâ€”that way, we can swap them around if we
so choose.

`doc/` contains documentation and thoughts about the project. Naturally,
this is a revision controlled repository, so change things up as you see
fit!
